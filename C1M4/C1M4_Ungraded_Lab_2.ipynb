    "## 1 - Text Classification with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting and practical application of language models (LLMs) is transforming them into text classifiers. With good instructions, you can guide an LLM to categorize text based on sentiment, task type, and more. Since classifiers typically output fixed labels (such as 1 for positive and 0 for negative), you need to construct a prompt that minimizes the likelihood of the LLM producing unexpected outputs. Besides designing a robust prompt, implementing checks in your code is something to consider to avoid potential issues, such as a function later in the process expecting values of 1 or 0 but receiving an unexpected value like 2 or a phrase such as \"positive sentence.\" This combination of strategies ensures reliable classification results while maintaining flexibility in handling unforeseen outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's suppose you are developing a chatbot for a company that sells sport outfits and nutritional supplements. The idea is to make an LLM decide if the query is related to outfits or nutrition. This might be useful to redirect your LLM to the correct database to query from.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be precise. You need to explain exactly what you want it to do and output.\n",
    "2. Add examples. Create examples with their expected result.\n",
    "3. You might add also edgy examples, i.e., examples that you know that might be hard for the LLM to properly decide."
